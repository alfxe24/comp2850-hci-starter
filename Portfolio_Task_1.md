# Portfolio Task 1 Notes


## **Create a Task-Based Usability Evaluation**
Design and execute a task-based usability evaluation with peer pilots (n=4 minimum), collecting quantitative metrics and qualitative observations to identify accessibility and usability issues in your HCI implementation.




## **Notes on what i'm doing**
- Based on the code created in weeks 6 - 8 of the Task List System:
    - Task Management Interface (CRUD Operations)
    - Server-First Architecture (Ktor + Pebble Templates)
    - HTMX Progressive Enhancement
    - No-JS Parity (all features work w/o JS)
    - Accessibility Features (ARIA, Keyboard Navigation, semantic HTML)

- Will need to conduct an interview with someone.
    - Ask people about if they use XXX, what they like about it, what they don't, why they like specific things and don't like others.
    - Avoid leading questions, and closed answer questions (Yes or No questions, or questions where they feel as though they wanna give you the answer you want).
    - Get people to talk about their experiences and reflect.
    - Don't write everything they say, take notes.
    - Consent Script
        - Consent script elements:
            - Purpose ("We're researching task manager usability")
            - What you'll do ("5-minute interview, taking notes")
            - Data stored ("Pseudonymised notes in local Git repo")
            - Rights ("You can stop at any time, request deletion")
            - Contact ("Email to opt out")

- Pilot Study
    - Based on website
    - Get people to do stuff and log how it takes them.
    - Change factors, e.g. turn off screen and use keyboard / screen reader.


## **Do before completing task**
- Research ARIA, Keyboard Navigation and Semantic HTML parts of the notes.
- Start again and re-do the Task List :sob:
- Make sure the file structure is easy to use.
